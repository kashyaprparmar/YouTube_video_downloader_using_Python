# YouTube_video_downloader_using_Python
The main idea of developing the YouTube downloader is that due to the Ease of availability of the videos from YouTube is sometimes required. For a normal person, there is not always availability of an internet connection and also viewing a YouTube video again and again will result into the leakage of the internet data. So he/she should be able to download a YouTube video in any format (.mp4 or .webp) and in any resolution(144/240/36-/480/720/1080 pixels) when there is keen requirement and so he/she would spend their internet data only one time to watch each video and the availability of all resolutions make it possible to spend low amount of internet data. All he/she needs is only a URL link to get this YouTube video downloaded.
